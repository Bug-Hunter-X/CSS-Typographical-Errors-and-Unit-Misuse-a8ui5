# CSS Typographical Errors and Unit Misuse

This repository demonstrates common CSS typos and how to fix them.

The `bug.css` file contains CSS code with typographical errors. The `bugSolution.css` file provides the corrected code.

**Common issues illustrated:**

* Misspelled CSS properties (e.g., `bacground-color` instead of `background-color`)
* Incorrect use of units (e.g., `width: 100%px;`)

These errors can lead to unexpected visual results and are difficult to debug.  Pay close attention to spelling and unit usage when writing CSS.
